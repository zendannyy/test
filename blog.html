        <h2 id="intro_post">Intro Post</h2>
        <p>Are you starting out your career in tech? Or maybe you have been interested for a long time and are thinking
            of making the pivot?
            I would assimilate getting into tech as getting better at basketball, now let me tell you what I mean by
            that.
        </p>

        <p> With minimal equipment, you can practice the sport and over time improve your game (all you need is a ball
            and a makeshift hoop). < -- This is how I started üòÖ With the proper motivation you can continuously get
                better at basketball and this doesn‚Äôt require anything fancy or a huge investment. </p> <p>
                Likewise, getting your foot in the door in the field of technology is very much similar. With minimal
                overhead, you can learn and practice your technical skills,
                all you need is a laptop and drive (see what I did there)

                Someone who is willing to put in the time and the effort behind the keyboard is very much able to land a
                career in tech.
                And that's the thing about this field, it requires self-motivation a lot more than formal training
        </p>

        <p>And here's a great quote from Pinterest on
            <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/746893919450504035/">‚ÄúMaking it happen‚Äù</a>
            <img id="create" src="create_opportunity.jpg" alt="Create Opprotunity Quote">
        </p>

        <p>
            Much like someone looking to improve their skills
            in the basketball example; they could dribble over and over, they can practice their shot over and over,
            until they see the strides being made. But this is where the difference maker comes into play, without a
            doubt once they play in pickup games with other players they will see their playing level go up that much
            more. The added skill sets and necessary adjustments to be made on their part, will enable this player to
            improve.
        </p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Skills Required to be successful in Tech</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Persistence</td>
                    <td>General Curiosity</td>
                    <br />
                    <td>Flexibility</td>
                    <td>General Computer Fundamentals</td>
                </tr>

            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>The same goes in the field of tech. You can definitely self-teach a lot and rinse and repeat,
            but the strides are made when you speak with others in the field and get involved in the community. I can
            attest to this, and it is great to know that there are folks who want to see you succeed.
        </p>

        <p>
            And that is why I started this website, to help others that want to get into the field of tech and those
            that are early in their careers with some doubts learn more.
